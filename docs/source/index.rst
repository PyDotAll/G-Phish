Welcome to TranscribeAI's documentation!
===================================

**TranscribeAI** is a Python library that aims to train an ai to conversate as a customer service representative. It uses generative AI (state of the art) to mimic the voice of a human accurately and most importantly, to achieve a smooth call flow.I'm planning to make a *simple* and *intuitive* API to let everyone use its capabilities.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
