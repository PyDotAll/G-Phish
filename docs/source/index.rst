Welcome to TranscribeAI's documentation!
===================================

**TranscribeAI** is a Python library for training interactive conversation between a customer and an ai.
It uses generative AI (state of the art) to mimic the voice of any customer service accurately. I'm planning to_
make a *simple* and *intuitive* API to let everyone use its capabilities.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
