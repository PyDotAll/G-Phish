### Overview
This repository contains the source code for creating a formal phishing attack in Gmail. The concept commonly relies on JQuery code injections somewhere in the HTML content of the sign-in page, using a minimal CDN in JS. However, in spite of the possibillity, there's no foolproof method for real hacking. The purpose of this code is to create a formal proof of concept for establishing a phishing attack that's specifically catered in Gmail. 
### Pros
- Code injection within '<script>' tag
- Interaction between the attacker and the victim
- Easy to use with little to no setup
- Based on Google's current CSS selectors 
### Cons
- Runs on http but will soon be run on https
- Does not support anonymity in the account creation, use with precaution
- Still fixing checkbox that's triggering the malfunction
### Installation
